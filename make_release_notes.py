# juju-core {version}

A new development release of Juju, juju-core {version}, is now available.
This release replaces version {previous}.


## Getting Juju

juju-core {version} is available for vivid and backported to earlier
series in the following PPA:

    https://launchpad.net/~juju/+archive/devel

Windows and OS X users will find installers at:

    https://launchpad.net/juju-core/+milestone/{version}

Development releases use the "devel" simple-streams. You must configure
the `agent-stream` option in your environments.yaml to use the matching
juju agents.

Upgrading from stable releases to development releases is not
supported. You can upgrade test environments to development releases
to test new features and fixes, but it is not advised to upgrade
production environments to {version}.


## Notable Changes

## Resolved issues

Finally

We encourage everyone to subscribe the mailing list at
