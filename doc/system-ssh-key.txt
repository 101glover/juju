The idea of having a system SSH key is to support a number of real and
potential use-cases.

A system key is generated when the environment is bootstrapped, and uploaded
as part of the clout-init machine creation process. The public key part is
added to the authorized keys list.

This means that we need to generate an identity file and the authorized key
line prior to creating the new machine.

If subsequent state server machines are created, they also need to have the
system identity file on them. Actually, it is most likely the API server jobs
that we really care about.
